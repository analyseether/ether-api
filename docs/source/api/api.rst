Application Programming Interface(API)
======================================

ether-api provides a list of links at which GET requests can be targetted by the client. This section aims at detailing the various api links available in the library in detail.

We use the `Click <http://click.pocoo.org/5/>`_ library to generate CLI groups and their nested commands in a tree structure.
